# 📋 April Lab Retest Checklist: Indicators of Success
**Patient:** Shane Antyr  
**Context:** 6-month follow-up on "HMGB1-Reducing Protocol" and testing the "Post-COVID Thyroiditis" hypothesis.

## 1. Thyroid Health (The "Post-COVID" Validation)
*This is the primary area to determine if the autoimmune response is fading as expected.*

| Marker | Previous (Oct 2025) | **Target Trend for April** | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TPO Antibodies** | **190 H** | **📉 DOWNWARD TREND** | A drop (e.g., to <150) confirms the autoimmune "fire" is burning out, supporting the post-viral theory over progressive Hashimoto's. |
| **Thyroglobulin Ab** | **9 H** | **📉 Decrease** | Should move closer to the reference range (≤ 1). |
| **TSH** | 2.63 | **↔️ STABLE** | Goal: **1.0 – 2.5**. Stability here proves your thyroid gland is functioning perfectly despite the antibody presence. |

## 2. Cardiovascular Risk (Lipid Particle Quality)
*Measuring the impact of Berberine, Omega-3s, GlyNAC, and Vitamin K2.*

| Marker | Previous (Oct 2025) | **Target Trend for April** | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LDL Particle Number (LDL-P)** | **1281 H** | **📉 Significant Drop** | **Goal: < 1100**. Reducing the *number* of particles is more important than total cholesterol. |
| **LDL Peak Size** | **218.1 L** | **📈 INCREASE** | **Goal: > 222.9**. We want particles to get "fluffier" (larger), making them less likely to stick to artery walls. |
| **Small LDL** | **218 H** | **📉 Decrease** | A reduction here indicates lower insulin resistance and lower oxidative stress. |
| **Omega-3 Index** | **5.1%** (calc) | **✅ ≥ 8.0%** | Confirms your 3g/day dosage is absorbing and providing maximum cardiac protection. |

## 3. Hormones & Minerals (Lifestyle & Nutrient Correction)
*Measuring the impact of Zinc supplementation and stopping the 18-hour daily fasts.*

| Marker | Previous (Oct 2025) | **Target Trend for April** | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zinc** | **59 L** | **✅ NORMALIZED** | **Goal: > 80 mcg/dL**. Correcting this is vital for immune regulation and thyroid health. |
| **SHBG** | **78 H** | **📉 Decrease** | **Goal: < 60**. Lowering SHBG will naturally raise your Free Testosterone. This validates the switch to a shorter (12h) overnight fast + increased protein. |

---

## 4. Red Blood Cells & Methylation
*Measuring the impact of the Methylated B-Complex and GlyNAC.*

| Marker | Previous (Oct 2025) | **Target Trend for April** | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MCV** | **100.9 H** | **📉 Return to Normal** | **Goal: 80–100**. Indicates healthy, normal-sized red blood cells are being produced with adequate B12/Folate. |
| **MCH** | **33.5 H** | **📉 Return to Normal** | **Goal: 27.0–33.0**. Similar to MCV, tracks methylation status. |
| **Homocysteine** | 9.4 | **📉 < 9.0** | *Optional but recommended.* Lower is better for cardiovascular and brain health; confirms B-vitamins are working. |

---

## 5. Systemic Inflammation
*Measuring the "Total Load" of inflammation.*

| Marker | Previous (Oct 2025) | **Target Trend for April** | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **hs-CRP** | 1.2 | **📉 < 1.0** | Pushing this lower confirms that the anti-inflammatory diet and GlyNAC are suppressing systemic inflammation (HMGB1). |

## 🏆 Definition of Success for April
**Success does not mean "Perfect Numbers" across the board.**
Success looks like:
1.  **Zinc and Omega-3s** are fixed.
2.  **Lipids** are shifting from "Small/Dense" to "Large/Fluffy."
3.  **Thyroid Antibodies** are lower than before (validating the healing process).
4.  **SHBG** has dropped, reflecting better metabolic balance.
