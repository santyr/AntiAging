# 🌿 The Comprehensive HMGB1-Reducing Stack

*A natural, science-backed protocol using fasting, targeted nutrition, therapeutic compounds, and lifestyle strategies to reduce HMGB1 expression and systemic inflammation. This version is adapted for weight maintenance or gain and includes an advanced optional module for psycho-spiritual health.*

---

> This protocol integrates several powerful, evidence-based strategies to create a synergistic anti-inflammatory effect. The core goal is to inhibit the release and activity of **High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1)**, a key alarm protein that drives chronic inflammation when overexpressed. By combining intermittent fasting, specific foods, potent natural compounds, and lifestyle factors, this stack aims to promote cellular repair, enhance metabolic health, and build systemic resilience.

## 🧬 Fasting Component: The Autophagy Activator

Fasting is a cornerstone of this protocol as it is the most potent non-pharmacological way to induce **autophagy**, the body's cellular cleanup process. Autophagy can directly degrade intracellular HMGB1, preventing its release.

### ✅ Daily Protocol: 16:8 Intermittent Fasting
- **Fasting Window**: 7:00 PM – 11:00 AM (16 hours)
- **Eating Window**: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM (8 hours)

### 🔁 Optional Quarterly Protocol: 36-Hour "Monk Fast"
**Once every 3 months for a deep cellular reset.**

## 🍄 Optional Neuro-Regulatory & Psycho-Spiritual Module

**Disclaimer:** *This is an advanced module. These substances carry significant psychological risks and are illegal in many places. They should be avoided by individuals with a personal or family history of psychosis. Prioritize harm reduction, including set, setting, and integration, at all times.*

This module enhances the protocol by reducing stress, promoting neuroplasticity, and improving mind-body connection, which are critical for long-term adherence and reducing the psycho-emotional drivers of inflammation.

### Psilocybin Protocol

|---|---|---|---|
| **Microdosing** | **0.1g - 0.25g** dried *Psilocybe cubensis* or equivalent. | **1 day on, 2 days off** (e.g., Monday/Thursday). | Consistent background support for mood, stress resilience, and neuroplasticity. Helps break ingrained habits and improves adherence to the protocol's lifestyle changes. |
| **Rare Macrodose**| Therapeutic dose used infrequently. | **Quarterly to annually**, as needed. | For a profound reset of perspective, processing deep-seated stress patterns, or overcoming significant behavioral hurdles. Requires extensive preparation and integration. |

### DMT Protocol
