# 🌿 Daily HMGB1-Reducing Stack  
*A natural protocol using green tea, turmeric, resveratrol, cacao, olive oil, berberine, and intermittent fasting to reduce HMGB1 expression, release, and inflammatory signaling.*

---

## 🧬 Fasting Component

### ✅ Daily Protocol: 16:8 Intermittent Fasting
- **Fast from 7:00 PM to 11:00 AM**
- **Eating window: 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM**
- Drink **green tea** and **water** during the fast
- No calories, oils, cacao, or supplements until 11:00 AM

> 💡 This supports autophagy, improves insulin sensitivity, and lowers HMGB1 expression and inflammatory signaling.

---

### 🔁 Optional Monthly Protocol: Monk Fast
- **Duration**: ~36 hours
- **Example**: Finish dinner Sunday 7:00 PM → eat again Tuesday 7:00 AM
- Only **water, plain tea, electrolytes** allowed
- Avoid workouts and heavy cognitive tasks on day 2
- Break fast gently with a small meal + **Golden Green Shot**

> 🧬 Purpose: Deep HMGB1 reset via full autophagy and anti-inflammatory gene expression shift.

> 💡 *Purpose*: Provides epicatechin and procyanidins to reduce HMGB1-linked inflammation; olive oil supports absorption.

## 🟡 Optional Add-On — Berberine

### Use Case:
- Reduces HMGB1 release, supports metabolic/gut health, lowers systemic inflammation

### Dosage:
- **500 mg**, **1–2x/day**, 15–30 minutes **before meals**

### Cycling:
- 4–8 weeks on, 1–2 weeks off  
  OR
